<p>Finally we were in the step 3, you are ready for login in the Administrative Area(index_admin.php).</p>
<p> <img src="../images/install3.gif" width="446" height="258"></p>
<p>Basic installation won't require more of 40 seconds. Now that you log in with your username and password. You should create Urgency levels and Departaments. Before of creating any ticket. </p>

The  charset is &quot;iso-8859-1&quot;, if required edit PhPMailer. PhPMailer uses mail, sendmail, qmail and SMTP. Ask to your web hosting provider about the right method. </p>
<h3 class="titulo">about users of Facil HelpDesk<a name="3"></a> and accounts </h3>
<p><br>
  Facil HelpDesk has three types of users:<br>
</p>
<p><span class="content">End-user</span>(<span class="content">User Accounts</span>)<br>
  This user can create new support tickets, and receive answers for their tickets
  through a simple  interface or email. They can also post follow-ups and
  messages to departaments( every departament should have one or more staff members). End users log requests in the system via the web based
form.</p>
<p><br>
  <span class="content">Staff member</span><br>
  The staff member are the ones that answer to user requests. They can view the
  tickets, reply to tickets, assign tickets to other 
  departments. They can also search for tickets and perform most common ticket
  operations. Staff users are created from the administration section, these are the
  users who will respond and manage incoming tickets. Each person you wish to grant
  access to the staff area requires a valid staff account.<br>
</p>
<p><span class="content">Administrator</span><br>
  This has the role of a super-user, he is the one that configures all the options in
  Facil HelpDesk. The administrator configures essentially everything that can be
  configured, including  departments,email options, delete, suspend users, etc. There is only one
administrator by default, created during the last step of installation. </p>
<p>In the next image we can see  urls that are used for login. <img src="../images/login.png" width="550" height="200" border="0"></p>
<p>It means that  <strong>end users only are able to fill their user and password</strong> at index.php, if they tries to use index_admin.php, they will be redirected to index.php </p>
<h3><span class="titulo">How To Register(c<a name="4"></a>reate an account for using Facil HelpDesk for end users from index.php)</span></h3>
<p><br>
  Once you open Facil Help Desk, <strong>index.php</strong>, you will be prompted with the next screen:<img src="../images/index.gif" width="499" height="351"></p>
<p>To register for a new account, simply click the<strong> Register</strong> link and the registration
process will begin. You will be prompted with the next page:</p>
<p><img src="../images/register.gif" width="592" height="391"></p>
<p>You must enter your username, your password, your name and  email, as
  well as the company name and the URL(optionals). Once you have entered all the required
  information, press the Submit button. You should receive a  email for confirmation shortly (if <strong>&quot;Enable email verification</strong>&quot; is active),
  the open your email client and open the new email, click the Activate now link and your browser will open a new url, finally the active page will show you: <strong>your registration has been completed</strong>  successfully (only after of clicking the email confirmation)</p>
<p><span class="content"><img src="../images/email_confirmation.gif" width="423" height="73" border="1"></span></p>
<h3 class="titulo">Creating users from <a name="5"></a>administrative url (index_admin.php) </h3>
<p>The same users, the staff members or the administrator are able to create accounts. But users or staff members are able to create single users, <strong><em>only the administrator can add more staff members</em>.</strong></p>
<p>If you create a user who is moderator or staff member(those who will answer tickets), you should <strong>include this user to the respective Departament</strong>, else he won't be able to respond nor watch any ticket. Isn't enought to be staff member.</p>
<p>Only the administrator is able to change permissions, save settings, delete users and others features. For example if an staff member tries to save settings, the action will fail and he will get an warning in the top if the current window : <span class="comment2">Denied only administrator</span></p>
<h3 class="titulo">End-user area<a name="6"></a></h3>
<p><br>
Navigate to URL of your website<strong class="boxbordertop"> index.php</strong> and you should see the Facil Help Desk startup screen:<img src="../images/login2.png" width="494" height="342"></p>

<h3 class="titulo"></h3>
<h3><span class="titulo">Staff Area and Administrator Area <a name="7"></a></span></h3>
<p><br>
  Getting started in this area is also simple, and can be followed in a few quick 
  and easy simple steps.
Navigate to the URL of your website: <strong>i<span class="boxbordertop">ndex_admin.php</span> . </strong></p>

<p> <img src="../images/assign_ticket.png" width="995" height="530"></p>
<h3>Understanding email notifications</h3>
<p>Facil HelpDesk receives tickets from web and email, every time that a response or an assignement is done a notification can be generated. </p>
<p><strong>Ocurrences of notifications:</strong></p>
<p>- The user creates a new ticket, then he receives an email notification when Facil HelpDesk stores his ticket and the departament receives a notification simultaneously with the user. </p>
<p>- One staff member anwers a ticket, then the user gets a notification, &quot;a response is available&quot;. </p>
<p>- The user adds a response to an existing ticket, then he receives a notification and also the departament gets one.</p>
<p>- The administrator assigns a ticket to one individual staff member then the tickets gets &quot;unreaded&quot; and a notification is sent to a individual staff member. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h3><br>
  <span class="titulo">Control Toolbar<a name="8"></a></span></h3>
<p><br>
  After logging in into the staff area or end user area, you have access to the control toolbar available<br>
  always at the top of the page you are currently browsing:</p>
<p><img src="../images/main_tickets.png" width="969" height="506"></p>
<p> <span class="content">Tickets</span><br>
  This will open a list of available options just below the control bar (listed in the
 screenshot below). These are:<br>
</p>
<p class="content">New Ticket</p>
<p> By clicking this link <strong>your staff can create tickets in the system on behalf of users</strong>, or
  simply as an internal ticket. This is especially required for people who operate call
  centers or have a phone in help desk.<br>
  This will log a new ticket, opening a page where you can enter the username of
  interest, the contact's email, the name of the ticket, the department to whom to
  address this ticket to, the user to whom to assign this ticket to, the priority of the
  ticket, its status.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Don't use this link if there are hundred or thousand of users, <strong>go to Users</strong>(alphabetically ordered by username) and <strong>Click </strong>the button<strong> Create ticket</strong> as shown in the figure.</p>
<p><img src="../images/create_ticket.png" width="912" height="298"> </p>
<p class="content">Search</p>
<p> This will browse the tickets system looking for subjet, body, username <strong>and will return with tickets</strong> with results if available, use 5 or more characters for search. </p>
<p><img src="../images/search.png" width="549" height="119"></p>
<p>Each person you would like to respond to tickets, or manage tickets including the administrator requires a staff account. These accounts are created by the administrator.<br>
Each staff member will get a username and password, with which they can use to login to the staff section of Facil HelpDesk (<strong>i<span class="boxbordertop">ndex_admin.php</span></strong>). You can also limit access of individual staff members by editing the users profile in &quot;Departaments&quot;. You can give access to as many departments as you wish.</p>
<h3><span class="titulo"></span><img src="../images/departaments.png" width="898" height="416"></h3>
<p class="content">knowledge base</p>
<p>This will open the page of base of articles, where you can search for a specific item in a
  specific category or create a new one(not end users). </p>
<p><span class="content">Add a new article</span>(In administrative menu, for staff members and administrator)</p>
<p><br>
  This will allow you to add a new article to the knowledge base. This way you can<br>
  inform users of any vital information.</p>
<p><img src="../images/articles.png" width="978" height="976"></p>
<p>If a staff member enters as end user to <strong>index.php</strong>(requires authentication) he will be able to edit and delete comments for every article. This option isn't available for end users. Only they can add comments but not edit nor delete them. Example of an article. </p>
<p><img src="../images/end_user_articles.png" width="831" height="468"></p>
<p>There is no relationship between departaments and categories of articles. It is suggested to create several  categories related with departaments. </p>
<p><strong>Storing images</strong></p>
<p>The editor used is FCKeditor, to store images create a folder named <strong>UserFiles</strong> in your root web server. Example: http://www.algo.com/UserFiles</p>
<p><span class="content">Reports</span> (for staff members and administrator)<br>
  This will open a page of reports, where you can view tickets by assignment, by
  department, by priority vs status, the number of tickets created by month, date interval, response time, banned tickets and others.</p>
<p><span class="content">Polls:</span> If polling is enabled edit includes/polls.php, by default there are 4,5 questions, if you want delete 1 , 2 , 3 or 4 of them. The results are stored for every posible question(max 5 in the database), every poll with the case number(ticket ID), can be voted only 5 times and expires.</p>
<p>In the section &quot;tickets by staff members&quot; there is something that can be confussing, &quot;opened tickets&quot; it means the number of tickets that were read by first time for a user. If a user(of your staff member) has a high value for opened tickets and a low number for closed tickets it means that he is opening ticket and not giving solutions. </p>
<h3><span class="titulo">Settings</span></h3>
<p>There are six sections: Basic settings and URLs, colors, Localization, Mysql database, Acess and E-mail </p>
<p>Every setting has a short explicative label, only the administrator is able to save these settings. </p>

<h3>Creating tickets<a name="14" id="14"></a></h3>
<p>End user are able to create tickets ckicking New Ticket. The end user needs to select a departament and a level of urgency. Also staff members and administrators are able to create new tickets, in this case tickets are sended to users not to departaments. </p>
<h3 class="titulo">Multilanguaje support <a name="18" id="18"></a></h3>
<p>If you want the tickets system in other languaje diferent from english,<strong> translate the files</strong> found in the directory &quot;languaje&quot; , by default only the file en.php (english) is operative. </p>
<h3 class="titulo">Tickets status</h3>
<p>A new ticket has the state <strong>&quot;Opened&quot;</strong>, and it will remain in this state until an staff member, user or administrator closes it(the case was resolved) or <strong>&quot;Hold&quot;</strong> the ticket(if the ticket requires special atencion). </p>
<p><strong>&quot;Closed</strong>&quot; tickets can be opened again, only tickets who are not in &quot;close state&quot; can be responded. </p>
<h3 class="titulo">Personalization<a name="16" id="16"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Email notifications </strong></p>
<p>When are created notifications by email, are used 4 template files: </p>
<ul>
  <li>email_new_ticket_from_user.php (when the end user creates a ticket) </li>
  <li>email_new_ticket_from_user.txt (when the end user creates a tic ket) </li>
  <li> email_notification.php (when the staff members creates a response) </li>
  <li>email_notification.txt (when the staff members creates a response) </li>
</ul>
<p>Depending if you select notifications in plain text the text files will be used, in these files there are a few of constanst that are replaced, example: $message, $poll, etc. . You can alter the format of those  files, but keeping them  in the  &quot;templates&quot; folder. </p>
<p><strong>Articles or database knowlegde</strong></p>
<p>Every article is created from the file index.php, example: www.site.com/tickets/kbase/index.php</p>
<p>Index.php uses two includes, for these reason you can replace <strong>index.php</strong> with your own template and add these two includes to index.php: <strong>header.php</strong> and <strong>cuerpo.php</strong></p>
<p><strong>main tickets system</strong></p>
<p>This section can not be changed easily, but here you can alter top.php, top2.php , bottom.php, tickets.php and ticket2.php. Top2.php and tickets2.php are used for  administrative users. </p>
<p>You can select colors of buttons, consider that are used 4 colors for creating two png files with degradation of top navigation bar, the color of default text and  color of top.php. </p>
<p>Facil HelpDesk supports several languajes but only english is operative, if you want translate the file: languajes/en.php to your own languaje and alter index.php</p>
<p>For english exists the file en.php, if you edit index.php you will see it, en.php=en+.php. </p>
<p>Locale: <br>
&lt;<span class="red2">select name</span>=&quot;langdefault&quot; id=&quot;langdefault&quot;&gt;<br>
&lt;option value=&quot;<strong>en</strong>&quot;SELECTED &gt;<strong>English</strong>&lt;/option&gt;<br>
&lt;option value=&quot;no&quot; &gt;no&lt;/option&gt;<br>
&lt;option value=&quot;es&quot; &gt;Espa&ntilde;ol&lt;/option&gt;<br>
&lt;option value=&quot;fr&quot; &gt;french&lt;/option&gt;<br>
&lt;option value=&quot;gm&quot; &gt;gm&lt;/option&gt;<br>
&lt;/select&gt; </p>
<p>You can add as many languajes as you want not only five. Creating an entry in the <span class="red2">select</span> and creating a file at folder &quot;languajes&quot; with the same value. </p>
<h3 class="titulo">Email piping (requires cron) <a name="piping" id="piping"></a></h3>
<p>Facil HelpDesk is able to handle  request from email, There is an script (by default: &quot;for_cron.php&quot; ) who will read your POP3 accounts and will create tickets, the username used for this purposes is &quot;Unregistered&quot;. </p>
<p>This function reads <strong>emails and creates tickets sending notifications</strong>, but before of using email piping you should know  that <strong>your host provider could limit the number of emails deliverered from PHP</strong>, example: 200 emails/hour, if the script &quot;for_cron.php&quot; is executed every hour and there were 300 emails including 100 junk emails, email notifications will be lost for several email submissions. </p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong>  if you delete the user &quot;Unregistered&quot; of your database you will never be able to read those tickets because tickets coming from email are assigned to user &quot;Unregistered&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="../images/emailpiping.png" width="898" height="205"></p>
<p>Go to Departaments, you will see an email for every departament and it's password. These accounts have two purposes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Send a notification every time that a new ticket is created from the web interface index.php -&gt; tickets.php </li>
  <li>the script for_cron.php reads these email accounts periodically and creates tickets </li>
</ol>
<p>Be carefull with these accounts and passwords, if one of them is wrong the script won't work(for_cron.php), for watching the errors go to reports-&gt; email piping, look at the image, here cron will be executed every 5 minutes <strong>&quot;for_cron.php&quot;</strong>, if there are too many emails, consider adjusting the time interval to your needs.</p>
<p> <img src="../images/cron.png" width="541" height="393"></p>
<p>For your security rename the file: for_cron.php, use email accounts of the same email server or you will get errors. </p>
<p>Example For creating email notifications for new tickets you use: <strong>not_reply@myweb.com</strong> the emails of yours departaments should be: <strong>sales@mysweb.com</strong>, <strong>support@myweb.com</strong>, etc. </p>
<p>In our server(cromosoft.com) for testing purposes cron is executed every 15 minutes, it means that if you send an email to: sales@cromosoft.com, your email will be converted to ticket after of 15 minutes. </p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you enable email piping, don't use the same email for notifications to staff members  or disable &quot;Email Staff if there is a new ticket&quot; as shown in the figure.</p>
<p><img src="../images/disable_notif.gif" width="458" height="311"> </p>
<h3 class="titulo"></h3>
<p>If  email piping is enabled a notification is sent when an <strong>email is transferred to ticket</strong> as shown in the figure.<img src="../images/casenumber.gif" width="624" height="321" border="1"></p>

<p><span class="titulo">Typical Errors and solutions<a name="17" id="17"></a></span></p>
<p><strong>Updating PHPMailer </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>If you decide to update phpmailer, delete empty spaces of files: class.phpmailer.php, phpmailer.lang-en.php at the end of these files. Or the &quot;header&quot; command of php will fail. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>During installation </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The file <strong>configuration.php</strong> must be writable for everybody (change to 777) </li>
  <li>Create departaments and urgency levels before of creating tickets. Important!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Using the tickets system</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>If you decide to close several tickets at once,  notifications won't will be sent, if you want notifications  open and close ticket by ticket. </li>
  <li>The number of responses for a ticket(submitted by email) shows 0 but is incorrect, but there are responses when i open the ticket. <strong>Solution:</strong> check if the user <strong>Unregistered</strong> exists, if not then create the username <strong>Unregistered</strong> with name <strong>Unregistered</strong>, the counter for new tickets will be updated for new tickets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="titulo">Maintenance and limitations <a name="maintenance" id="maintenance"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Maintenance</strong></p>
<p>Facil HelpDesk uses a non transacctional database, MyISAM, with 15 tables, more tables will be added in  futured versions for advanced functions but these aren't important. </p>
<p>For storage of tickets Facil HelpDesk  uses <strong>&quot;tickets_state&quot;</strong> and <strong>&quot;tickets_tickets&quot;</strong> , every valid ticket requires an entry in these tables. The most important is <strong>&quot;tickets_tickets&quot;</strong> if there is a ticket in the tickets_tickets who doesn't have an entry in tickets_state <strong>this ticket won't be visible</strong>. Manual work could be required to create an entry in this table. The other<strong> table who is critical is users</strong>, this table contains: username, password, etc.</p>
<p>Check your tables and script(sometimes scripts gets corrupted on web servers) periodically, use your favorite tool for backup and restore of your database depending of the volume of tickets and <strong>set offline Facil HelpDesk during this task.</strong> </p>
<p>Check and delete the file error_log of your web server if available for errors with php scripts.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>
<p><strong>number of tickets</strong></p>
<p>The number of tickets is limited to a unsigned integer with size 10 (<FONT face=Arial size=1>BIGINT</FONT>), the number of tickets also is limited to  10 bytes. Example this ticket ID can be stored: </p>
<p> <strong>tickets_id: 
12345678912345700</strong>, every  ticket inserted will add 1 to  tickets_id.</p>
<p><strong>Related with &quot;email piping&quot;</strong></p>
<p>This function reads <strong>emails and creates tickets sending notifications</strong>, but before of using email piping you should know that <strong>your hosting provider could limit the number of emails from PHP</strong>, example: 200 emails/hour, if the script &quot;for_cron.php&quot; is executed every hour imagine for a moment that  during it's execution there are 300 emails including 100 junk emails, waiting be converted to tickets, but there is a limitation(200 emails/hour) and 100 notifications will be lost permanently. But tickets will be stored, in every case we are supposing that the entire queue of email is processed.</p>
